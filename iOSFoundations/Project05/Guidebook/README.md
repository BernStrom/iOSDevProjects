### Guidebook

Guidebook is a city guide app that contains a list of popular attractions local to the area.

The app contains 3 different screens that starts off from selecting a city and simply tapping on it reveals the next screen for a list of local attractions.

After tapping on an attraction, the next screen will display more info on the selected attraction and a button that redirects the user to the Map App with the precise location, along with other info such as user-submitted reviews, photos, ratings, etc.

Note: *As of this writing, there is only a pre-determined number of cities and attractions in the app as the data is parsed from a JSON file that sits locally within the app bundle. More cities & attractions can always be added by simply adding the data to the JSON file.*
