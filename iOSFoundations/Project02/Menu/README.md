## About the app

### Menu

Menu is a simple scrollable list of sushi items that contains the individual item's data; image, item name and price. There are no other interactice features within the besides being scrollable.

The purpose of this app was simply to practice multiple concepts of app-building such as, but not limited to, displaying data in a scrollable list, app architecture, data modelling, UI-building, applying the D.R.Y (Don't Repeat Yourself) methodology in code, along with some basic Swift concepts such as Arrays & Structures.
