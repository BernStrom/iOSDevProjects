### Overview

My personal app development projects built with the iOS SDKs. Majority of the projects are built in *[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)* & *[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)*, with some in various other frameworks like UIKit, MapKit, SwiftData, etc.

Scale of the projects listed here are range from small to medium. As for large scale projects, they will always have their own standalone repository.

#### Apps:
- [Citysights](Citysights/) - Shows popular locations & venues in the city based on your nearby location.

- [Guidebook](Guidebook/) - Simpler version of Citysights app, with a fixed data set of city guides.

- [Restaurant](Restaurant/) - A sushi restaurant app with tab bar navigation and image sheet overlay.

- [Movie](Movie/) - Simple scrollable list of movies with different tab views.

- [Menu](Menu/) - Simpler version of Restaurant app, with only a scrollable list of food items.

- [War](War/) - Playing card game app that randomly draws and compare their strength against each other.
